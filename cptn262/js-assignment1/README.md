# Assignment #1 - Adding Tiles

In this assignment, we are going to take an array of data and turn that into tiles on the index page.
These tiles are created from data that looks like the following:

```js
const item = {
    name: 'Item A',
    color: 'red',
    price: 0.23
}
```

Make buttons at the top that display the same data but order them by:

-   name
-   color
-   price

## How will this be marked?

#### I will not mark your assignment until the following is true:

-   Can I visit a github repo?
-   Can I visit a url to see the final result?

#### Requirements

In order to get 90%, I will be asking the following questions

-   Do the tiles match the data in the javascript file (1 point)
-   Did your solution use a loop? (1 point)
-   Did you use variables (1 point)
-   Did you keep your code shallow (did you stay under 2 nested levels)
-   Do you have 1 button that orders tiles by name
-   Do you have 1 button that orders tiles by color
-   Do you have 1 button that orders tiles by price

#### Over and Above

In order to get above 90%, you will need to do one of the following:

-   change the grid tiles so it matches the inspiration img
-   add background pictures to the tiles while still making sure the text is readable
